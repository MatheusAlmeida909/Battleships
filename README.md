# Battleships
A little project focusing on developing a battleship type game in C++

This project started as a group assignment at college, but I decided to step it up and make something better out of it

The main ideia is to take the original code in C and take it to C++ and later adding GUI,
I'm going to post this first version of it in C here and keep updating until the final goal
